Dr. Mary Bassett defended her actions as a way to encourage children to get injected with the COVID-19 vaccine. Bassett made this admission during a Dec. 28, 2021 press conference. She said that only a small number of children being admitted to hospitals have COVID-19, and there was no 'epidemic of infection' at all. However, a handful of rare pediatric hospitalizations were lumped in the actual count – increasing the total reported number of children sent to hospital for COVID infection.",

Public health officials of Massachusetts said that starting from Jan. 10, hospitals in Massachusetts will be reporting whether admissions are 'primary or incidental to COVID-19,' reported Boston Globe. The state's daily update for 'patients hospitalized for COVID-19' currently counts both types of admissions.",

When the corrupt US Government addressed COVID they put in place unique ways of reporting deaths.  They began by claiming every death where someone was suspected of having COVID when they died was to be recorded as a COVID death. This resulted in thousands of deaths being reported as COVID deaths that were not.  We reported on this in August 2020.",
